"""
This test case script calculates aerodynamic coefficients for the horizontal stabilizer of a simulated Sirosky UH-60 Black Hawk using Python.
The script utilizes parameters such as wing span, wing chord, wing thickness ratio, and aspect ratio specific to the copter selected, all defined in a configuration dictionary (config).
Additionally, flight parameters such as cruise speed, altitude, speed of sound, kinematic viscosity, and density are specified to compute the Mach number and Reynolds number necessary for aerodynamic calculations.
