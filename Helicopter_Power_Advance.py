def w_tilde_function(V_inf_tilde, alpha_deg):

    '''
    Description: this function solves the fourth grade's equation which describes the operation's curve of a stiff rotor in advance. The equation
    is obtained in the hypotesis of rotor's operation with a constant thrust (a dual theory in the hypotesis of constant power exists but it is not
    widespread). The equation is:

    w_tilde^4 + 2*V_inf_tilde*sin(alpha)*w_tilde^3 + V_inf_tilde^2*w_tilde^2 - 1 = 0

    The unknown is w_tilde. In general there are four roots for every couple (V_inf_tilde, alpha), but this function selects only real and positive
    solutions. These solutions are ordered in ascending order and then the function chooses the smallest one.

    Input:
    - V_inf_tilde: defined as V_inf/w_h, where V_inf is asymptotic velocity and w_h is induced velocity on disk rotor in hovering
    - alpha_deg: Angle of Attack (AoA) of disk rotor with respect to asymptotic velocity in degrees.

    Output:
    - w_tilde: defined as w/w_h, where w is induced velocity on disk rotor and w_h is induced velocity on disk rotor in hovering. The function choose
      the smallest real positive solution of the equation.

def P_c_0_function(sigma, Cd_mean, mu, K = 4.7):

    '''
    Description: this function computes the parasite power's coefficient P_c_0 of a stiff rotor in advance. Integrating the parasite power
    absorbed by a generic blade element at the station r along the radius R, with the blade at the generic angular position psi (psi: azimuth angle
    of the blade), one can obtain the mean parasite power absorbed by a single blade of a stiff rotor in advance, during a single rotation. One can
    multiply this integral for N, number of blades, to obtain the mean value of the entire disk rotor. In the hypotesis of rectangular form for the
    blade and introducing a mean drag coefficient, one can obtain the following expression:

    P_c_0 = (sigma*Cd/8)*(1 + K*mu^2)

    Input:
    - sigma: solidity of disk rotor, defined as N*c/(pi*R), where N is the number of blades, c is the mean chord of the elements and R is the radius
             of disk rotor
    - Cd_mean: mean drag coefficient of the elements of blades
    - K: coefficient which takes into account the velocity of flux along the direction of radius. Without this contribution, the theory gives
         K = 3. Taking into account this effect, one can select a number included in the range [4,5]. Stepniewski and Keys (1984) suggest
         K = 4.7. This is the default value in this function.
    - mu: advance ratio, defined as V_inf*cos(alpha)/(omega*R), where V_inf is asymptotic velocity, alpha is Angle of Attack (AoA) of disk rotor with
          respect to the asymptotic velocity, omega and R are, respectively, the angular velocity and radius of disk rotor.

    Output:
    - P_c_0: Parasite power's coefficient of a stiff rotor in advance.

def P_c_Fus_function(mu, f_over_A = 0.009):

    '''
    Description: this function computes parasite power's coefficient absorbed by the fuselage of an helicopter in advance. This is the
    non-dimensional form of the work of the aerodynamic drag of helicopter (except the main rotor) in the time's unity.
    Starting from the dimensional relation of a power:

    P_fus = f*(1/2)*rho*V_inf^3

    where:
    - f is the equivalent wetted area, has a dimension of a surface and is defined as the sum of C_d_n*S_n. C_d_n and S_n are, respectively,
    the drag coefficient and the reference surface of the n-element of fuselage (generic element of the fuselage).
    - rho: density of the air
    - V_inf: asymptotic velocity
    
    One can obtain the correpsonding non-dimensional form:
     
    P_c_Fus = (1/2)*(f/A)*mu^3

    with respect to a reference's power, defined as rho*(Omega*R)^3*A, 
    where:
    - Omega is the angular velocity of disk rotor
    - R is the radius of disk rotor
    - A is the area of disk rotor (pi*R^2).

    Input:
    - mu: defined as V_inf/(Omega*R), where V_inf is asymptotic velocity, Omega and R are, respectively, the angular velocity and the radius
     of disk rotor
    - f/A: where f is the equivalent wetted area and A is the disk area of rotor. An optimistic value of f/A is 0.007. The default value of
    this function is 0.009, as suggested by Ing. Di Giorgio from Leonardo.

    Output:
    - P_c_Fus: Parasite power's coefficient absorbed by the fuselage of the helicopter in advance (the entire helicopter except the main rotor)
